# Numbers Analyzer 🧮

**Author:** Muhammad Ramzan  
**Project:** Numbers Analyzer  

This Python program takes multiple integers from the user and provides a summary analysis of the numbers. It calculates total, average, maximum, minimum, even and odd counts, and unique numbers. It also displays the numbers in sorted order.  

The project demonstrates the use of:

- Loops for iteration  
- Conditional statements for checking even and odd numbers  
- Lists and list comprehensions  
- Sets for identifying unique numbers  
- Built-in Python functions like `sum()`, `max()`, `min()`, and `sorted()`  
- User input handling and basic validation  

**Example Usage:**

```python
Enter multiple numbers separated by spaces: 5 12 7 12 9 0
Sorted Numbers: [0, 5, 7, 9, 12, 12]
Total: 45
Average: 7.50
Maximum: 12
Minimum: 0
Odd Numbers: 3
Even Numbers: 3
Unique Numbers: [0, 5, 7, 9, 12]

# ⚡ Basic Engineering & Automation Tools

This directory contains functional scripts and logic-building tools. As a beginner in Python, I am using these projects to apply my Electrical Engineering knowledge to real-world code scenarios.

## 🎯 Current Phase: Logic & Problem Handling
My focus is on:
 **Manual Tool Building:** Creating calculators that solve basic circuit problems.
 **Conditionals & Validation:** Learning to handle edge cases like zero or negative values.
 **Formula Implementation:** Correctly translating engineering formulas into executable code.

*Note: These tools are exercises to strengthen my core programming foundation before moving to professional-scale applications.*

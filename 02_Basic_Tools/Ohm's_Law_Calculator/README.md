# 📟 Basic Ohm's Law Calculator

## 📝 Description
This is a foundational engineering tool designed to solve for one of the three primary variables in Electrical Circuit Analysis: Voltage ($V$), Current ($I$), or Resistance ($R$). 

The tool is built using core Python programming concepts to demonstrate logical branching and basic user-input handling.

## ✨ Features
 **Multi-variable Selection:** Allows the user to choose exactly which parameter they need to calculate.
 **Mathematical Accuracy:** Uses standard Ohm's Law formulas ($V = I \times R$).
 **Zero-Division Protection:** Includes basic conditional checks to prevent "Infinity errors" when resistance or current is zero.
 **Simple Interface:** Clean command-line prompts for ease of use.

## 🛠️ Programming Concepts Used
 **Input Handling:** Taking and converting user data to `float` and `int`.
 **Conditionals:** Using `if-elif-else` structures to direct program flow.
 **String Formatting:** Utilizing `f-strings` for clear result display.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
 This is a **Beginner-Level** tool; it does not yet include loops for repetitive calculations or advanced error handling for non-numeric strings.
 Input validation is currently limited to zero-value checks.

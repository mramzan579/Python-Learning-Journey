# Number System Converters 🧮

**Number System Converters**

This project demonstrates Python programs for converting numbers between different number systems, starting with a **Decimal to Binary converter**.  

The current program handles:

- Positive, negative, and zero integers  
- Loops for repeated division and remainder calculation  
- Lists to store binary digits  
- String manipulation to produce the final binary result  
- Conditional statements for zero and negative numbers  
- User input validation  

**Example:**

```python
Enter any integer: -34
Binary: -100010

# 📚 Python Practice Lab

This folder contains my daily practice sessions and conceptual exercises. My goal here is to master the syntax and logic of Python, one topic at a time.

## 🛠️ What's Inside?
-Separate Files for Topics: Each file represents a specific Python concept (e.g., `day_01_lists.py`, `day_02_loops.py`).
-Logic Building: Solutions to basic programming challenges and syntax drills.

## 🚀 Learning Goals
Data Types (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries).
Mastering Control Flow (If-Else, Loops).
Writing clean and readable code.

Progress: Consistent learning and daily commits.
